Although the sections above describe our primary purpose in collecting your information, in many situations we have more than one purpose. For example, if you complete an online purchase, we may collect your information to perform our contract with you, but we also collect your information as we have a legitimate interest in maintaining your information after your transaction is complete so that we can quickly and easily respond to any questions about your order. As a result, our collection and processing of your information is based in different contexts upon your consent, our need to perform a contract, our obligations under law, and/or our legitimate interest in conducting our business.
We use personal information to create de-identified, aggregated, or anonymized information such as: information about demographics, de-identified location information, information about devices used to access our Services, and de-identified, aggregate, or anonymized information on transactions on our Services that help our users understand and optimize sales. To the extent we maintain and use personal information in a de-identified form, we will not attempt to reidentify the information, except for the purpose of determining whether our deidentification processes satisfy our legal obligations.

How We Disclose Information
In addition to the specific situations discussed elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, we may disclose personal information in the following situations:
Affiliates
We may disclose your information to our affiliated companies.
Business Transfers
We may choose to buy or sell assets, and may disclose and/or transfer customer information in connection with the evaluation of and entry into such transactions. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, personal information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.
Credit Evaluation
If you are extended payment terms, we may disclose aggregated payment performance information to third-party service providers that report on payment performance to PIBOOGO and other businesses.
Service Providers
We may share your information with service providers. Among other things, service providers may help us to administer our website, conduct surveys, provide technical support, process payments, and assist in the fulfillment of orders.
Advertising on the PIBOOGO Platform
We may allow advertisers and/or merchant partners (“Advertisers”) to choose the demographic information of users who will see their advertisements and/or promotional offers. We may provide any of the information we have collected from you in non-personally identifiable form to an Advertiser, for that Advertiser to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements and/or offers. For example, we might use the fact you are in San Francisco to show you ads or offers for San Francisco businesses, but we will not tell such businesses who you are. Or we might allow Advertisers to display their ads to users with similar usage patterns to yours, but we will not disclose usage information to Advertisers except in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. Note that if an advertiser asks us to show an ad to a certain audience or audience segment and you respond to that ad, the Advertiser may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they were trying to reach.
Third-party Advertising
We want to make sure that our advertising is relevant and interesting to you and our other users. To achieve this, we use specialized third-party advertising companies, including companies that collect data about you to build a profile of your preferences based on your activities when you visit or use the Services. We also use these companies to automatically collect data from you when you use the Services to help us identify the ads that are served to you and what you do after seeing those ads. When you enter your email address or similar details through our Services (either to log in, or to sign up for a service, newsletter, or similar), we may disclose personal or other information that we collect from you, such as your email (in a hashed form) or other unique identifiers, to third-party technology companies that help us personalize our services to you (including our ads). For example, we may use Meta’s custom audience and conversion offerings and disclose your email address and other identifiers in a protected format with Meta so that we can: include you in a custom audience that we will serve relevant advertising content to on Meta platforms; or create an audience of other Meta users based on the information in your profile (i.e., Instagram or Facebook platform). You can manage the data which is disclosed by such third parties with us by amending your preferences, using the privacy settings which these third parties provide on their platforms. For further information relating to our third-party partners or to opt-out of such sharing of your information, please reach out to us via privacy@piboogo.com(우리 이메일 주소 기재).
User Profiles and Submissions
Certain user profile information, including your name, location, and any video or image content that such user has uploaded to the Services, may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the Services or address your request for our services. Your account privacy settings may allow you to limit the other users who can see the personal information in your user profile and/or what information in your user profile is visible to others. Please remember that any content you upload to your public user profile, along with any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose online in a manner other users can view (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, etc.) becomes publicly available, and can be collected and used by anyone. Your username may also be displayed to other users if you send messages or comments or upload images or videos through the Services and other users can contact you through messages and comments.
Other Disclosures without Your Consent
We may disclose information in response to subpoenas, warrants, or court orders, or in connection with any legal process, or to comply with relevant laws. We may also share your information to establish or exercise our rights, to defend against a legal claim, to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding possible illegal activities, suspected fraud, safety of person or property, or a violation of our policies, or to comply with your request for the shipment of products to or the provision of services by a third-party intermediary.
Other Disclosures with Your Consent
We may disclose your information to other third parties when we have your consent or direction to do so.

Your Choices
Some jurisdictions give you the right to make the following choices regarding your personal information:
Access
You may request access to your personal information or confirmation that we have information about you. In certain limited circumstances, you may also request access to your personal information in a portable, machine-readable format.
Correction
You may request that we correct personal information that is inaccurate or incomplete. Note that we may keep historical information in our backup files as permitted by law.
Deletion
You may request that we delete your personal information.

Opt-out of Targeted Advertising
You may opt-out of targeted advertising by clicking the “Cookie Policy” link on our homepage and locating the Cookies Settings link. Please note that if you change browsers or computers, or if you clear your browser’s cache, you may need to click the link again to apply your preference.
Objection to or Restriction of Certain Processing
In certain circumstances, you may object to the processing of your personal information, or request that we restrict processing of your personal information. This may include objecting to decisions based solely on automated processing, including profiling, and requesting human intervention in relation to an automated decision so that you can express your view and contest the decision.
Revocation of Consent
Where we process your personal information based upon consent, you may revoke consent. Please note, if you revoke your consent for the processing of personal information, we may no longer be able to provide you with your services.
Online Tracking
We do not currently recognize the “Do Not Track” signal.
Promotional Communications
If you no longer wish to receive promotional communications from us, follow the unsubscribe instructions in the message that you receive from us. Note, if you decide not to receive promotional communications, we may still send you service-related communications.
Please note, not all the rights described above are absolute, and they do not apply in all circumstances. In some cases, we may limit or deny your request because the law permits or requires us to do so, or if we are unable to adequately verify your identity. We will not discriminate against individuals who exercise their privacy rights under applicable law.

Submitting Requests
You may exercise the rights described above by contacting us as described in the “Contact Information” section below. To protect your privacy, we may take steps to verify your identity before fulfilling your request, such as by asking you to log in to your PIBOOGO account or confirm your email address.
If you are a California resident, you may designate an authorized agent to submit requests to exercise certain privacy rights on your behalf. To do so, you must (1) provide that authorized agent written and signed permission to submit such a request, and (2) verify your own identity directly with us. If you are an authorized agent submitting a request on behalf of an individual, you must contact us as described below and provide written proof that you are able to act on another person’s behalf.

How We Protect Information
No method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is fully secure. While we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information. In the event that we are required by law to inform you of a breach to your personal information, we may notify you electronically, in writing, or by telephone, if permitted to do so by law.
Some of our websites permit you to create an account. When you do, you will be prompted to create a password. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password, and you are responsible for any access to or use of your account by someone else who has obtained your password, whether such access or use has been authorized by you. You should notify us of any unauthorized use of your password or account.

How Long We Retain Information
We generally retain your personal information for only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the information, the purposes for which we obtained the information, and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, as well as applicable legal requirements.

International Transfers of Information
As a multi-national company, we transmit information between and among our affiliates and service providers. As a result, your information may be processed in a foreign country where privacy laws may be less stringent than the laws in your country. Nonetheless, where possible, we take steps to treat personal information using the same privacy principles that apply pursuant to the law of the country in which we first received your information. By submitting your personal information to us, you agree to the transfer, storage, and processing of your information in a country other than your country of residence, including, but not necessarily limited to, the United States where our global headquarters are located. If you would like more information concerning our attempts to apply the privacy principles applicable in one jurisdiction to data when it goes to another jurisdiction, you can contact us using the contact information below. You may also request a copy of any Standard Contractual Clauses we use for the transfer of your data outside of the EEA or the United Kingdom by contacting us as described in the “Contact Information" section below.

Third-Party Websites
For your convenience, we may provide links to websites and other third-party content or services that we do not own or operate. The websites and third-party content to which we link may have separate privacy notices or policies. Please note, we have no control over the privacy practices of websites or services that we do not own. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party website or application for details about such third party’s privacy practices.

Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes to our practices, technology, legal requirements, and other factors. When changes are made to this Privacy Policy, they will become immediately effective when published. You can check the “Last Updated” legend at the top of this page to see when this Privacy Policy was last revised. We will take reasonable steps to alert you to material changes by placing a notice on the https://www.piboogo.com website, by sending you an email, and/or by other means.
