PIBOOGO, RETAILER TERMS OF SERVICE

Last Updated: March 1, 2025


1. Overview
Thank you for your interest in becoming a Retailer on the PIBOOGO wholesale online marketplace, accessible through its websites (collectively, the “Site”) and mobile applications (collectively, the “Application”) (together, the “Services”). Throughout these Retailer Terms of Service (“Retailer Terms”), the terms “PIBOOGO,” “us,” and/or “we” refer to PIBOOGO. The terms “you” and/or “your” refer to you as a user of the Services as a Retailer. These Terms, along with PIBOOGO’s Terms of Service (the “General Terms”) and Privacy Policy, govern your purchase of goods as a Retailer through the Services. These Retailer Terms reference and link to various PIBOOGO policies that provide additional details regarding the Services, and such policies are incorporated herein by reference and are to be treated as part of these Retailer Terms. You hereby acknowledge and agree to the terms and conditions set forth below. Capitalized terms used herein but not defined shall have the meanings given to them in the General Terms. Throughout these Retailer Terms, the word “includes” or “including” means “including, but not limited to.”

2. Key Definitions
“Brand” means a seller who offers to sell and/or sells its goods to Retailers through the Services.
“Retailer” means a buyer who purchases goods through the Services for the purpose of resale.

3. Account Registration – Retail Account
Retailer Account. To purchase goods through the Services as a Retailer, you must register, create a retailer account, and be approved by PIBOOGO (“Retailer Account”), as further set forth in the General Terms. We reserve the right to deactivate your account if we find that you are in breach of these Retailer Terms, including if you are selling products in non-PIBOOGO approved locations or on other platforms other than PIBOOGO (as further set forth in these Retailer Terms).
Qualifications. To qualify for a Retailer Account, Retailers must have an online, brick-and-mortar, or pop-up store that is open and ready for business (authorized subscription boxes and booths may also qualify at our discretion). You must also have, and upon request provide proof of, a valid reseller’s permit or ID (or your state’s or region’s equivalent documentation). You agree that all purchases are made on behalf of your business, and that you are not making any purchases for any personal purpose. You also agree that any extension of payment terms will be used solely for business and commercial purposes.

4. Product and Content Compliance
You acknowledge and agree that PIBOOGO is not required to determine whether the products sold on the Services, or any Content related thereto:
(i) abide by PIBOOGO’s Product Guidelines and/or are not prohibited under PIBOOGO’s Product Guidelines;
(ii) comply with all laws, rules and regulations, including but not limited to, safety, labeling, testing, warning, import/export, and/or other consumer protection law requirements;
(iii) do not infringe upon the intellectual property, publicity, or other rights of others;
(iv) do not contain false, inaccurate, or misleading information;
(v) are allowed to be sold from the Brand’s jurisdiction and/or into your jurisdiction; and/or
(vi) are allowed to be sold by you from your jurisdiction into your customer’s jurisdiction.
You agree to conduct the necessary due diligence for compliance and suitability of PIBOOGO and their products. You hereby release PIBOOGO from any liability with respect thereto, and agree to indemnify, defend, and hold PIBOOGO harmless for any claims as set forth in the Indemnification section below.

5. Orders
Prohibition on Fulfillment Using Third Party Websites. You agree not to fulfill orders on third party websites unless they are approved by PIBOOGO. Prohibited sites include Amazon, eBay, Etsy, and Postmark.
Order Minimums. Brands may specify a minimum dollar amount a Retailer must spend before PIBOOGO is willing to sell to a Retailer (an “Order Minimum”). This amount is set by each Brand and may vary between Brands. Brands have the option to set a different Order Minimum for first orders and reorders you place with them.
Right to Refuse. You acknowledge and agree that Brands and/or PIBOOGO may refuse to complete your purchase for any reason.
Inventory. PIBOOGO will encourage Brands to have sufficient inventory to sell goods to Retailers. However, you acknowledge and agree that PIBOOGO does not guarantee a Brand's inventory or that there will be enough products to sell to you.
Testers and Samples. Brands may sell testers. You may add only one tester per product SKU to any full order. Samples are currently not made available by a Brand. Please note that in the event you purchase testers, they are non-returnable and non-refundable.
No Circumvention. You acknowledge and agree that you will place all orders for a Brand's product through the Services for any Brand that you are first introduced to through the Services. You acknowledge and agree that you will not influence Brands, or otherwise circumvent PIBOOGO’s process or the Services, by transacting orders with Brands you were introduced to through the Services outside of the Services. Failure to comply with this provision may result in temporary suspension or permanent termination of your Retailer Account and your ability to purchase products on PIBOOGO in the future.
PIBOOGO Protection. PIBOOGO Protection is a program in which Brands, at their option, offer Retailers 90 days of postal code exclusivity protection for orders placed with that Brand on the Services. That means that the first Retailer to order from the Brand in a specific postal code will have 90 days of exclusivity with that Brand for the postal code where the Retailer is located. No other Retailers in that postal code will be allowed to purchase products from that Brand during the 90-day exclusivity period from PIBOOGO. If the Retailer does not re-order from the Brand after the 90-day exclusivity period ends, then PIBOOGO Protection ends for that Retailer, and another Retailer in that same postal code will be able to place an order and trigger PIBOOGO Protection for 90 days. PIBOOGO Protection is only available for orders placed on the Services. PIBOOGO cannot guarantee the exclusivity of postal codes beyond purchases placed on the Services and shall not be held responsible in such circumstances.
Shipping Address and Drop Shipping. You agree to provide a valid, physical address to receive the product that you order through the Services. 
Taxes. You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for the collection and remittance of any taxes, including sales taxes, as well as any other payments or filings required under applicable law. You hereby release PIBOOGO with respect thereto, and agree to indemnify, defend, and hold PIBOOGO harmless for any claims as set forth in the Indemnification section below.

6. Payment
Payment Methods. To make a purchase, you must link an approved payment method (such as a credit or debit card, but excluding pre-paid cards) with your Retailer Account. Approved payment methods may vary by region. By submitting payment details in conjunction with registering for a Retailer Account and/or purchasing goods, you agree to pay for the goods purchased, and any applicable taxes and other fees that may accrue, and you authorize PIBOOGO and/or its affiliates to charge the payment method with the information you have supplied to PIBOOGO, and/or to credit that payment method to make any adjustments if necessary. PIBOOGO reserves the right to correct any errors in pricing. We will charge your default payment method on file in your Retailer Account. If it fails, we reserve the right to charge any other payment method you have included in your Retailer Account.
Payment Processors. PIBOOGO uses third-party service providers for credit card payment processing, fraud alerts, payment processing and disbursement of funds to Brands. You acknowledge and agree that PIBOOGO may share information about you with those payment processors to complete the transaction.
Payment Accounts. PIBOOGO offers two types of payment accounts depending on the type of Retailer business (as described below): (1) Net 60 Terms Account (“Terms Account”); and (2) Payment on Shipment Account:
Terms Account. PIBOOGO offers certain Retailers the option to purchase products with a Terms Account. To be eligible for a Terms Account, you must be approved by PIBOOGO. Your account may be reviewed for terms once your first order is placed and before it begins processing. If you are eligible for a Terms Account, then PIBOOGO will not charge your account until invoices are due 60 days after the order is placed. However, you have the option to pay your invoices sooner by logging onto your Retailer Account and paying any outstanding invoices. PIBOOGO reserves the right to have spending limits under this type of account. Once you either return the products (if eligible), or pay for the products, your credit balance will decrease. You may request to have your credit limit increased by requesting to do so in your Retailer Account. Any purchases made over the credit limit must be paid upon shipment. You agree that you will not create multiple accounts to circumvent spending limits.
Payment on Shipment Account. If you are not eligible for a Terms Account, you must make payment when the product is shipped by the Brand. Your method of payment will automatically be charged once the order is in transit.
Failure to Make Payment & Payment Plan Program. You acknowledge and agree that if you fail to make timely payment for any goods you ordered through the Services, PIBOOGO may, at its option and without notice to you, demand immediate payment of all outstanding invoices, cancel or suspend orders, suspend or revoke your line of credit, offset monies that may be owed to you, assess late payment penalties at the highest rate allowed by law and/or temporarily suspend or permanently terminate your Retailer Account. PIBOOGO reserves the right to turn your account over to a collection agency or seek any other legal or equitable remedies available to collect any outstanding debt. You acknowledge and agree that if any payment becomes 60 days past due, and you have not otherwise opted into a payment plan program offered by PIBOOGO, PIBOOGO may automatically enroll you into a 3-month payment plan, and you hereby agree to pay the total amount due in equal weekly installments over such 3-month period. PIBOOGO reserves the right to apply a fee for this service. This payment plan program is only applicable to the purchase of goods, and does not apply to any paid subscription plans or other services.

7. Shipping Costs and Lead Times
Shipping Costs. Shipping costs will be included on your invoice. Unless you receive free shipping on an eligible order, you are responsible for and agree to pay for all shipping costs displayed on your invoice, as well as any customs and/or duties on international orders.
PIBOOGO’s Brand Set Shipping feature (“Brand Set Shipping”) allows Brands to (i) pre-select the shipping rate (“Flat Rate”) that you will pay to ship your order to your designated location, or (ii) provide free shipping to you if the order value is above the minimum that the Brand selects (“Free Shipping Minimum”).
If a Brand is not using Brand Set Shipping (or if a Brand’s Flat Rate or Free Shipping Minimum does not apply to your order), your shipping cost will vary depending on the weight of the package and where the package is being shipped from. If a Brand has set a Flat Rate that is applicable to your order, your shipping cost will be the amount of such Flat Rate; if a Brand has set a Free Shipping Minimum that is applicable to your order, your shipping cost will be zero where such minimum order threshold has been met. You acknowledge and agree that the Brand reserves the right to request an adjustment to the shipping cost prior to order fulfillment of a Flat Rate order, which you may either accept or reject. If you do not accept the adjustment request (including by not responding to the notification from the Brand), your order will be canceled. If you accept the revised shipping cost, your order will be fulfilled, and you agree to pay the revised shipping cost as communicated by the Brand.
You acknowledge and agree that Flat Rates and Free Shipping Minimums are set by Brands in their sole discretion and may not be available in all areas or for all orders. PIBOOGO may terminate or modify the Brand Set Shipping feature without advance notice, at any time and for any reason.
Lead Times. You acknowledge that lead times vary on how long it takes for a Brand to ship a product. Average lead times are displayed on the Brand's page and/or when the product is in your cart. If any order takes longer than 2 weeks to ship, your invoice due date and return window (if applicable) are automatically extended by 2 weeks. Once the Brand accepts the order, the expected shipping date will be updated in your Retailer Account. You will receive a notice once the product has shipped, giving you a tracking number and letting you know the cost of shipping. This information is also available in your Retailer Account.

8. Returns, Refunds, Cancellations
Returns. PIBOOGO offers free returns on qualifying orders placed with any Brand only if the product is damaged, contains missing items, or does not meet the order specifications. To qualify for a return, you must contact PIBOOGO’s Customer Service to report on the issue. All returns must be initiated through PIBOOGO's Customer Service. Any orders from a Brand not covered in PIBOOGO’s Return Policy are not eligible for return, except under certain limited circumstances described therein. You acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for all shipping costs to your retail store, and those costs are non-refundable even if the return qualifies for free return under this Section.
Refunds and Cancellations. If you receive a product that is damaged, the shipment includes missing items, or you do not receive the product by the expected ship date, you must report the issue to PIBOOGO’s Customer Service within 14 days of receiving the product as outlined in our Returns, Refunds, and Cancellations Policy. You agree that if you do not timely report the issue, the product shall be deemed delivered and satisfactory.
No Consignment. The right to return goods as set out in Section 8 does not create a consignment sale arrangement.
PIBOOGO reserves the right to accept or reject any missing or damaged report filed by a Retailer in its sole reasonable discretion, including in the event PIBOOGO suspects of any fraudulent activity. PIBOOGO’s decision whether to accept a damaged or missing claim shall be final.

9. Customer Support
Retailers and Brands may contact each other directly through the Customer Support Services provided by PIBOOGO. You agree to use Customer Support only for legitimate business purposes, such as asking questions about a Brand’s products, the status of an order, or to resolve business issues. You agree to not abuse Customer Support, to use it only as is reasonably necessary and to not use it for the purpose of harassment or other improper purposes. If you are not able to get answers to your questions or resolve issues, you may contact PIBOOGO directly via phone or email.

10. Product Content
Limited License. PIBOOGO displays various Content related to the products, including photographs, product descriptions, Brand stories, and any other related content for sale on its Services. You are granted a limited, revocable, non-transferable license to use Content related to a product that you purchase on the Services for the sole purpose of reselling that same product. This license only applies to the use of Content on your own company’s website or other business-related platforms (e.g., social media pages) for resale purposes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree that you will not use any such Content in any ad or media campaign, including postings, emails, ads, or any other communication on platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, or Google, without the express written consent from the owner of that Content.
You acknowledge and agree that you are merely a licensee of the Content and that you do not own, and will not claim any ownership rights in, the Content. You further acknowledge and agree that PIBOOGO is not responsible, nor shall PIBOOGO be held liable, for any Content, and PIBOOGO makes no representation or warranty that the Content does not infringe, misappropriate, or violate a third party’s patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, moral rights, or other intellectual property rights, or rights of publicity or privacy, or contain libelous or otherwise unlawful, abusive, harassing, or obscene material, or result in the violation of any applicable law or regulation. You agree to indemnify PIBOOGO for any claims that arise from your use of Content in violation of these terms.
Ads and Sponsored Product Listings. You acknowledge and agree that the Services may display advertisements that are sponsored by PIBOOGO or by third parties, including Brands. Such advertisements do not constitute an endorsement by PIBOOGO of the Brand or product(s) displayed therein. PIBOOGO uses commercially reasonable efforts to identify advertisements, including sponsored product listings or sponsored search results, where displayed on the Services to the extent required to comply with applicable law. PIBOOGO shall have no responsibility or liability with respect to an action or omission that you make based on advertisements displayed through the Services.

11. Insider
The Insider terms and conditions apply to Retailers who are Insider members of PIBOOGO. By being an Insider member, you agree to abide by the specific rules and benefits outlined in PIBOOGO's Insider program.

12. Disputes
For any disputes regarding an order or product from a Brand, you agree to try to informally resolve the dispute directly with the Brand through PIBOOGO's Customer Support services. If you are not able to resolve the dispute, you may contact PIBOOGO directly via phone or email for further assistance in resolving the issue. You acknowledge and agree that PIBOOGO has no duty or obligation to resolve any issue you have with a Brand, and you hereby release PIBOOGO from all liability relating to any dispute you have with a Brand.

13. Indemnity
You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold PIBOOGO, and its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, partners, successors, and assigns, and each of their owners, members, officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, contractors, subcontractors, licensors, service providers, and third-party content providers harmless from any claims, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses, and fees (including reasonable legal and accounting fees) made by any third party due to or arising out of your violation of these Retailer Terms, the General Terms and/or any law or the rights of a third party, and/or your use of or participation on the Services.

14. Termination
If you breach any of these Retailer Terms, PIBOOGO will have the right to temporarily suspend or permanently terminate your Retailer Account, these Retailer Terms, and/or the General Terms in its sole discretion and without prior notice to you. PIBOOGO reserves the right to revoke your access to and use of the Services at any time, with or without cause. In the event PIBOOGO terminates these Retailer Terms, your Retailer Account, and/or the General Terms due to your breach, you will remain liable for all amounts due hereunder.
