PIBOOGO, BRAND TERMS OF SERVICE

Effective: March 1, 2025


1. Overview
Thank you for your interest in becoming a brand on the Faire wholesale online marketplace, accessible through our websites (collectively, the "Site") and mobile applications (collectively, the "Application") (together, the "Services"). Throughout these Brand Terms of Service ("Brand Terms"), the terms "PIBOOGO," "us," and/or "we" refer to PIBOOGO Inc. The terms "you" and/or "your" refer to you as a user of the Services as a Brand.
These Brand Terms, together with PIBOOGO’s Terms of Service ("General Terms") and Privacy Policy, govern your sale of products as a Brand through the Services. The Brand Terms also reference and link to various PIBOOGO policies, which provide additional details regarding the Services. Such policies are incorporated by reference into these Brand Terms and are to be treated as part of them.
By using the Services, you hereby acknowledge and agree to the terms set forth below. Any capitalized terms not defined in these Brand Terms will have the meanings given to them in the General Terms. For clarity, the terms “include” or “including” shall be interpreted as "including, but not limited to."

2. Key Definitions
A. “Brand” means a seller who offers to sell and/or sells its products to Retailers through the Services. The term “Brand” also includes “Distributor” as defined below.
B. “Distributor” means a seller who offers to sell and/or sells a third-party brand’s products to Retailers on the Services under express, valid, and continuous authorization from such third-party brand.
C. “Retailer” means a buyer who purchases products through the Services for the purpose of resale.

3. Account Registration – Brand Account
Brand Account: To sell products through the Services as a Brand, you must submit an application to become a brand and be approved by PIBOOGO for an account (“Brand Account”), as further set forth in the General Terms. By accepting these Brand Terms and providing the requested information (including any necessary documentation evidencing product compliance and safety, and if you are a Distributor, proof that you have the necessary rights from applicable third-party brands whose products you seek to distribute on the Services) during the Brand application process (as detailed in the General Terms), you authorize PIBOOGO and its affiliates and payment processors to settle and disburse funds to you and on your behalf, and on behalf of any third-party brands whose products you seek to distribute on the Services. PIBOOGO will use good faith efforts to review your application to become a Brand as soon as possible. You acknowledge that PIBOOGO is only able to accept a limited number of Brands at any given time, and that PIBOOGO is not obligated to accept you as a Brand. You hereby release PIBOOGO from any liability regarding the acceptance process.
Wholesale Relationships: PIBOOGO understands that Brands have sales representatives in certain territories. If you have such sales representatives, PIBOOGO will work with you to block off certain geographical areas where your sales representatives are located so that you do not receive orders from those geographical areas. To initiate geographical blocking, you will need to contact us.
Distributors: If you intend to distribute a third-party brand’s products on the Services, you must obtain express written consent from the applicable third-party brand. Such consent must include all relevant third-party brand details (including, without limitation, brand name, products to be sold, and relevant contact information), all of which PIBOOGO requires for legal and quality purposes. As a Distributor, you acknowledge and agree that a third-party brand may in its discretion choose to list its products directly on the Services, in which case the relevant products would be removed from your listing as a Distributor.

4. Onboarding
Shop Page
Each Brand has its own dedicated store page on the Site featuring its products (including descriptions and other pertinent information) (“Shop Page”). PIBOOGO will create and design your Shop Page with the information you provide (or you may do so yourself if certain self-onboarding features are available in our discretion, except that such self-onboarding features do not apply to Distributors unless otherwise authorized by PIBOOGO in writing in its sole discretion). You agree that PIBOOGO may adjust, edit, or remove Content you submit to comply with PIBOOGO’s internal specifications and requirements. PIBOOGO reserves the right to approve the final look and feel of your Shop Page in its sole discretion. To have PIBOOGO create your Shop Page, you must provide a catalog file, high-resolution photography (product and lifestyle) in accordance with PIBOOGO’s photography guidelines, and your minimum order number, all described below. PIBOOGO may ask for additional information as needed. As soon as your Shop Page is created, PIBOOGO will send you an activation email.
Catalog File
As part of the onboarding process, you are required and agree to submit to PIBOOGO a catalog file of your entire and complete wholesale product catalog containing the following information:
(i) product name;
(ii) individual or prepack;
(iii) product variations;
(iv) case size;
(v) wholesale price by region;
(vi) retail price;
(vii) product descriptions; and
(viii) whether products are active or inactive.
You acknowledge and confirm that all information provided in the catalog complies with applicable laws, including product safety and regulatory requirements, where necessary. The catalog must be in accordance with PIBOOGO’s Product Guidelines.
High-Resolution Photographs
You are required and agree to provide high-resolution photographs of your products in accordance with PIBOOGO’s photography guidelines. You represent and warrant that all photographs submitted are either owned by you or that you have the appropriate rights and licenses to use such images. Photographs that could reasonably be considered objectionable, profane, indecent, pornographic, harassing, threatening, embarrassing, hateful, or otherwise inappropriate are prohibited. You shall submit all photographs as indicated by PIBOOGO, and PIBOOGO will select the best quality and most appropriate photographs for your Shop Page. PIBOOGO reserves the right to reject content that violates PIBOOGO’s guidelines or these Brand Terms.
Order Minimums
You may set minimum order quantities for your products on a region-by-region basis. You acknowledge that minimum order quantities must comply with applicable local laws and regulations in the regions where your products are sold. If you wish to have minimum order quantities, you agree to provide PIBOOGO with your first order and reorder minimums (together, an “Order Minimum”), which will be displayed on your Shop Page.
Shipping Lead Time
You must set your typical shipping lead time, which should be an accurate estimation of your actual lead times and which you should use all reasonable efforts to meet. You acknowledge and agree that any inaccurate shipping lead time may result in customer dissatisfaction and potential liability. PIBOOGO reserves the right to adjust the shipping lead time, based on actual historical lead times. The lead time you set will be displayed on your Shop Page for the purpose of informing Retailers, who may rely on it when making a purchase. You must also enter an expected shipping date once orders are placed to approve/accept the order. You may edit your lead time in your Brand Account settings.

6. Product Listing and Compliance
Product Listing
PIBOOGO requires each Brand to list their entire wholesale catalog, unless otherwise agreed in writing by PIBOOGO, and provide a description for each product.

Failure to comply with PIBOOGO’s Product Guidelines may result in the temporary suspension or permanent termination of your Brand Account, at PIBOOGO’s sole discretion.

7. Product Pricing
Pricing Consistency
You acknowledge and agree that your prices on your Shop Page will be consistent with all other wholesale and retail channels where your products can be found in the applicable region. Product prices on your Shop Page must be displayed exclusive of indirect taxes, such as sales tax (in the U.S.), GST/HST, QST, PST (in Canada) or similar taxes.
Price Audits
You acknowledge and agree that PIBOOGO may perform routine price and content audits of the products listed on your Shop Page. That includes reviewing for wholesale and retail price consistency between your sites, and reviewing discrepancies that are communicated to us from Retailers. In the event a discrepancy is found, PIBOOGO may reach out to you and require certain action to be taken to resolve the issue. If you fail to properly and/or timely respond to the discrepancy, PIBOOGO reserves the right to temporarily suspend or permanently terminate your Brand Account.

8. Title, Returns, Promotions
Flash Title
With respect to orders between Retailers and Brands that are both located in the United States, title to the product(s) in the order passes to PIBOOGO upon shipment before immediately passing to the Retailer.
Product Returns
PIBOOGO allows returns only in cases where the product is defective, damaged, or significantly differs from the product description. Returns or refunds for any other reason are not accepted. Retailers have a limited period from the date the order is placed to request a return for defective or damaged products. No returns or refunds will be accepted for any other reason unless otherwise determined by PIBOOGO at its sole discretion. PIBOOGO, not the Brand, takes on the return risk in these cases, and returned items will not be deducted from your payout for the order.
For all orders (including orders), returns will only be allowed if the product is defective, damaged, or significantly differs from the description. PIBOOGO will not accept returns or offer refunds for any other reason.
Returned Products
PIBOOGO takes title to all products returned by a Retailer, subject to its return policies (not all products are eligible for return). PIBOOGO may, at its option, promote and distribute any returned products through its various redistribution channels. Retailers may purchase these returned products without meeting the Brand’s Minimum. You acknowledge and agree that PIBOOGO may promote and redistribute such products bearing your brand name through these and/or other avenues. If you do not want your returned products to be re-sold or redistributed by PIBOOGO, you may opt-in to our Buy-Back Program, where available, which will allow you to buy back your returned inventory subject to certain additional terms and conditions made available to you prior to opting in (PIBOOGO will also consider individual buybacks in its reasonable discretion).

9. Commissions, Payment Processing Fees, and Payout Schedules ( 전부 수정 필요 )
Acceptance of Terms
By accepting these Brand Terms, you acknowledge and agree to the commissions, Payment Processing Fees (as defined in this Section), calculations, other identified costs, and payout schedules set forth below. You agree and authorize PIBOOGO and/or its payment processors to deduct all commissions and fees due and owing from your payout amount, and to settle and transfer funds to your bank account as designated by you through your PIBOOGO account. If you are a Distributor, you acknowledge and agree that you have the power and authority to agree to the foregoing with respect to all third-party brands whose products you distribute on the Services.
Commissions
(i) Except as explicitly stated in these Brand Terms, PIBOOGO charges Brands the following commission (the “Commission”) on orders placed through the Services (at times referred to as the PIBOOGO “marketplace”):
For opening orders (i.e., the first order from a Retailer), the Commission charge is 15% of the Order Subtotal (as defined below) plus a new customer fee of ten dollars ($10)(USD); and
For reorders (i.e., subsequent orders from a Retailer), the Commission charged to a brand is 15% of the Order Subtotal.
As used herein, “Order Subtotal” means the total product cost, less brand-funded discounts as reflected in the invoice provided by PIBOOGO to the applicable Brand.
(ii) As further described in Section 19 (PIBOOGO Direct), PIBOOGO agrees to waive the Commission for Qualified PIBOOGO Direct Orders (as defined below) and a Brand pays 0% commission on such orders.
Calculation
Commissions are calculated based on the dollar amount of the Order Subtotal. Any items that a Retailer marks as damaged, missing, or otherwise defective are deducted from the payout of the order (PIBOOGO does not receive a commission on these items). If you send a replacement for a damaged, missing, or defective item, PIBOOGO will pay you for the invoiced cost of the replacement item.
Payout Schedule; Payment Processing Fee
(i) Payout Options. Brands can select how fast they want payouts to their designated bank account for orders placed with the Brand through the Services (each a “Payout Option”) subject to Section 9(d)(iv). PIBOOGO currently offers three Payout Options:
a 60-day payout.
a 30-day payout.
a next-day payout.
You can update your Payout Option anytime. You can visit our Help Center for details on how to update your Payout Option. If you update your Payout Option, that option will apply to pending and future orders as outlined in PIBOOGO’s then-current policies (available here).
(ii) Payment Processing Fee. As used herein, “Payment Processing Fee” means the fees from third-party payment processors along with the costs of managing flexible payment terms for retailers and guaranteeing brands get paid on time, regardless of when their Retailers pay or what payment method they use, and other costs including the costs of managing fraud, and the costs of chargebacks, late payments, and defaults. Please note that while PIBOOGO works to ensure Brands are paid on time, a payout to a Brand may not be completed for various reasons, including a Brand’s violation of its obligations under these Brand Terms, in the event of fraud, if ordered products are missing or damaged, or because of actions taken by your bank or financial institution. 
(iii) Brands will incur a Payment Processing Fee for each Payout Option as follows:
( 다른 b2b 플랫폼 기준으로 복사해서 가져온 내용임 ) 
Selected Payout Option
60 day
30 day
Next day
Payment Processing Fee
1.9% + US$0.30
2.4% + US$0.30
3.5% + US$0.30


(iv) Designated Payout Date
As used herein, the "Designated Payout Date" means the number of days applicable to your selected Payout Option (i.e., 60-day, 30 days, or next day). You acknowledge and agree that you are not entitled to any interest or other compensation associated with your selected Payout Option. The Payment Processing Fee is applied to the Order Subtotal and will be deducted from your payout amount and reflected on your Brand invoice.
Subject to your compliance with these Brand Terms, after a shipment of an order has been scanned by your shipping provider and is in transit, PIBOOGO will initiate the transfer of the amounts owed for such order in accordance with these Brand Terms to your designated bank account approximately on the next business day following the Designated Payout Date. It is anticipated that funds for any of the Payout Options will appear within 1 to 2 business days of being processed.

PIBOOGO is not responsible for any actions taken by your bank or financial institution that may result in some or all the funds not being made available to you. PIBOOGO reserves the right to suspend payouts to your bank account due to pending disputes, excessive chargebacks or refunds, as necessary to comply with any request from PIBOOGO’s third-party payment processors, and/or other improper or illegal activity as determined by PIBOOGO in its sole discretion.

Taxes
All of PIBOOGO’s fees (including Commission and Payment Processing Fees) are exclusive of indirect taxes, including sales tax and similar indirect taxes that may be applicable because of applicable U.S., Canadian, or other foreign law. All our fees are exclusive of applicable Canadian federal and/or provincial indirect taxes, including goods and services tax/harmonized sales tax (“GST/HST”), Quebec sales tax (“QST”), and/or provincial sales tax (“PST”). Such taxes shall be added to PIBOOGO’s fees for services as provided by law.
Applicable to Canada-based brands only: PIBOOGO will calculate the applicable indirect taxes payable (generally GST/HST, QST, and PST) for transactions entered with Retailers through the Services. Depending on your tax registration status, the nature of the supplies, and all other relevant factors, as provided to PIBOOGO, PIBOOGO may remit such taxes to you as part of the order payout for onward remittance to the appropriate tax authorities, or shall remit such taxes directly to the appropriate tax authorities.
Where such taxes are remitted to you, you acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for the onward remittance of any such taxes as well as any other payments or filings required under applicable law. You hereby release PIBOOGO with respect thereto, and agree to indemnify, defend, and hold PIBOOGO harmless against all such (withholding or other) taxes, contributions, penalties and/or interest, or any claim or action in relation therewith.

10. Shipping - Costs, Lead Times, Shipping Providers, Damaged Products
Shipping Costs
Brands have the option to use “Ship with PIBOOGO” (i.e., PIBOOGO-provided shipping labels) for PIBOOGO negotiated discounted shipping rates. PIBOOGO reimburses Brands only for shipping costs incurred by Brand if Brand chooses to ship on its own account and not with PIBOOGO. Where a Brand uses Ship with PIBOOGO, shipping costs may appear on a Retailer’s invoice, in which case such shipping costs will be excluded from the Brand payout. When you ship on your own account, shipping costs may not be inflated by Brand in any way. For the avoidance of doubt, PIBOOGO is not responsible for handling transport or customs clearance of any Brand products, whether you use Ship with PIBOOGO or ship on your own account. PIBOOGO and its customers have a shared interest in finding the fastest and most cost-effective shipping solutions. In some instances where PIBOOGO is funding shipping costs, PIBOOGO may require you to use Ship with PIBOOGO to ship your goods to Retailers or may limit your reimbursement amount to a rate PIBOOGO has negotiated with carriers if you choose to ship on your own account, at PIBOOGO’s discretion.
Tracking Number
If you ship on your own account, you will be asked by PIBOOGO for, and you agree to provide within your account, tracking information for each order, and if an order is shipped in multiple packages, you agree to provide tracking numbers for each package. When you input the tracking number(s), PIBOOGO will automatically send an email to the Retailer letting them know the order is on its way. Although not required, PIBOOGO recommends that you require a signature for your shipments to ensure delivery and provide evidence that an order was in fact received.
Damaged or Missing Products
Retailers are responsible for reaching out to you through the Services to try to resolve issues relating to damaged or missing items in an order. PIBOOGO will notify you if a Retailer reports to PIBOOGO directly that a product is damaged or if an order is missing items. PIBOOGO will pass along any photographs of any damaged item or of the order that it receives. You acknowledge and agree that you alone are responsible for resolving the issue. If you have shipped on your own account, you alone are responsible for making a claim with your shipping provider. You hereby release PIBOOGO from any liability about any damaged or missing items, whether you used Ship with PIBOOGO or shipped on your own account. PIBOOGO reserves the right to deduct payouts or charge the bank account or any payment method we have on file associated with your account related to items that are reported as damaged or missing. You have the right to dispute the charge with PIBOOGO, but we reserve the right to reject any dispute/claim created by you about the charge.
Shipping Insurance
PIBOOGO does not require you to purchase shipping insurance. However, whether you ship on your own or use Ship with PIBOOGO, PIBOOGO strongly recommends that you do so to facilitate any shipping dispute you have with a Retailer. Shipping protection and insurance may be offered by third parties. Unless explicitly agreed to by the parties in writing, PIBOOGO is not responsible for any shipping protection or insurance products.

11. Inventory, Orders, Recalled Products
Inventory
You agree to keep sufficient inventory on hand for products advertised as being available, and to keep inventory numbers current. You agree to promptly remove any products that are discontinued or are out of stock through your Brand Account portal. It is your responsibility to keep your product catalog current and up-to-date based on availability (whether items are back-to-date or discontinued).
Orders
PIBOOGO will send you an email each time a Retailer places an order for your products. Your Brand Account will also be updated with new order details. You will be able to review the order details, edit inventory availability and accept or cancel the order. You must accept or cancel an order within 2 business days of receiving the email notifying you of the order. If you cancel an order, you will be asked to provide a reason for not being able to fulfill the order. Repeated order cancellation may result in the temporary suspension or permanent termination of your Brand Account, in our sole discretion.
Right to Refuse
You have the right to refuse any order by a Retailer for any reason. Repeated refusal may impact on your visibility and search placement within the Services to Retailers.
Recalled Products
You agree to immediately inform PIBOOGO if any of your products have been recalled, giving at least the following information: (i) product name; (ii) SKU number or other identifying number; (iii) number of units sold to Retailers; (iv) purpose of recall; and (v) any other information necessary so that the products may be properly and quickly recalled.
No Circumvention
Once an order has been placed through your Shop Page by a Retailer, you agree that you will fulfill all orders placed by such Retailer through the Services. You further agree to not influence Retailers to transact offline outside of the Services in any manner, or otherwise circumvent PIBOOGO’s process to transact orders with Retailers who were introduced to you through the Services offline or outside of the Services in any manner. PIBOOGO reserves the right to deactivate or terminate your account if you fail to abide by these terms.
Pause Mode
If you are going on vacation, or are unable to accept new orders for a period, you may pause your Shop Page for up to 12 weeks at a time using “Pause Mode” found in your Brand Account tab. You will still be able to access your Brand Account, and we encourage you to fulfill any orders you have already accepted while on “Pause Mode.”

12. Commitment to Quality and Service
Minimum Standards
Brand and Retailer satisfaction is of utmost importance to the long-term health and success of the PIBOOGO community. Accordingly, Brands are subject to the following minimum standards in connection with the Services:
To accurately list and describe available products on your Shop Page.
To comply with any governmental guidelines related to product labeling.
To timely accept or cancel an order from a Retailer.
To timely fulfill and ship orders to Retailers using a reputable shipping provider.
To promptly and effectively respond to Retailer inquiries; and
To promptly resolve missing or damaged orders with a Retailer.
Metrics
You acknowledge and agree that to ensure that you are meeting the foregoing Brand’s minimum standard requirements, PIBOOGO will track and measure your performance using a variety of metrics, including collecting reviews and ratings from your Retailers. Reviewed individually and these metrics help PIBOOGO determine whether you are meeting PIBOOGO’s expectations on delivering a great experience for the Retailers. Such metrics also include:
Accuracy of product listings.
Catalog completeness.
How often do your shipments are later than the expected shipping date.
How often do you provide a valid tracking number.
How long does it take you to accept or cancel new orders.
How often are your orders reported as damaged or missing products.
How often your products are on backorder, returned or canceled.
How promptly and effectively you respond to Retailer inquiries; and
How promptly and effectively you resolve missing or damaged orders with a Retailer.
Volume Considerations
PIBOOGO takes volume consideration into account when calculating metrics. For example, if a Brand has only 10 orders, and 1 was damaged, then the damaged order rate is 10%. While that metric is technically over PIBOOGO’s target, it does not necessarily reflect an actual problem with performance given the low volume of orders.
Evaluation
PIBOOGO typically evaluates a Brand’s performance using the above metrics on an ongoing monthly basis, and more frequently during high volume periods such as the holiday selling season. The length of time between reviews depends on the volume of transactions of each flagged Brand Account and/or the extent of available data. PIBOOGO reserves the right to adjust its evaluation criteria as needed.
Accountability
If PIBOOGO determines that you are not meeting the minimum standards of quality and service, PIBOOGO may reach out to you to resolve the issue and/or temporarily suspend or permanently terminate your Brand Account. PIBOOGO also reserves the right to put limits on your Brand Account, lower your visibility and/or search placement across the Services, limit your ability to sell with new Retailers until you resolve outstanding issues, and/or deny signing up any affiliated, related or duplicate accounts.
Suspended Accounts
If your Brand Account is suspended for performance issues, you may appeal for re-activation by providing PIBOOGO with a plan of action for correcting the problems that contributed to the account being flagged and suspended. If PIBOOGO in its sole discretion approves the plan of action, you may resume selling through the Services. If you believe that the flag on your Brand Account is erroneous, you may contact PIBOOGO and explain why.

13. Promotion; Email and Marketing Tools
Unless you opt out as set forth below, PIBOOGO may feature certain Brands, products, and Content at the top of their respective category, on PIBOOGO’s landing pages, in advertisements, email, social media accounts, or in any other channels or media in its discretion. PIBOOGO may choose to bid on a Brand’s brand names and keywords relating to the Brand’s products in advertising products and may create SEO optimized pages or campaigns for Brand brands. PIBOOGO shall not be liable for any pricing or availability of a particular product featured in a particular ad or marketing. If you do not want to participate in the Marketing and Advertising Program, please contact us. PIBOOGO may also offer Brands email and marketing tools to use for their business. Additional terms and conditions may apply, including that all account leads must be sourced by you directly (purchasing lead lists from third parties is not permitted). You represent and warrant that you have and will have all requisite permissions and consents from a Retailer or prospective Retailer to provide their name and email address to PIBOOGO through your use of the Services, including any email and marketing tools. You acknowledge and agree that use of any email or marketing tools made available through the Services by you or your affiliates or agents will be in compliance with applicable laws, including without limitation, CAN-SPAM. Use of any email or marketing tools made available through the Services in a manner that could constitute unsolicited commercial email or “spam” under any applicable law or regulation is expressly prohibited, and PIBOOGO reserves the right to throttle or limit the number of emails sent to Retailers via such tools.


14. Customer Support
Retailers and Brands may contact each other directly through Customer Support on the Services. You agree to use Customer Support only for legitimate business purposes, such as responding to a Retailer’s question about your products or the status of an order, or to resolve business issues. You agree to not abuse Customer Support, to use it only as is reasonably necessary and to not use it for the purpose of harassment or other improper purposes. If you are not able to answer a Retailer’s question or resolve issues, you may contact PIBOOGO directly.

15. Product Liability Insurance
All Brands are required to maintain, at their own cost and expense, general commercial liability insurance (including comprehensive product liability) with respect to its products listed on PIBOOGO in such amount as is reasonable and customary for companies of comparable size and activities. PIBOOGO reserves the right to request proof of such insurance coverage and other relevant information at any time.
If a claim is made against a Brand by a Retailer or a third party due to defective or unsafe products, the Brand shall be solely responsible for the defense and settlement of such claim, and shall indemnify PIBOOGO from any liability, including any costs, damages, and legal fees, arising from such claim. The Brand must also immediately notify PIBOOGO of any claims, potential claims, or product recalls related to their products.
PIBOOGO does not assume any responsibility for the Brand’s product liability or the adequacy of the Brand’s insurance coverage.

16. Indemnity
You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold PIBOOGO, and its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, partners, successors, and assigns, and each of their owners, members, officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, contractors, subcontractors, licensors, service providers, and third-party content providers, harmless from any claims, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses, or fees (including reasonable legal and accounting fees) made by any third party due to or arising out of:
(i) your violation of these Brand Terms, the General Terms, and/or any applicable laws or the rights of a third party, and/or
(ii) your use of or participation in the Services.
This indemnity obligation includes but is not limited to any claims related to defective products, non-compliance with regulations, product liability claims, or any other actions that may arise out of your products, services, or conduct that affect PIBOOGO or third parties.

17. Prohibited Uses
PIBOOGO will have the right to fully investigate and prosecute violations of these Brand Terms permitted by law. PIBOOGO may involve and cooperate with law enforcement authorities in prosecuting users who violate these Brand Terms. You acknowledge and agree that PIBOOGO has no obligation to monitor your access to or use of the Services or Content, or to review or edit any Content, but has the right to do so for the purpose of operating the Services, to ensure your compliance with these Brand Terms, to investigate a complaint, or to comply with applicable law or the order or requirement of a court, administrative agency, or other governmental body.
PIBOOGO reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, to remove or disable access to any Content that PIBOOGO, in its sole discretion, considers to be in violation of these Brand Terms or otherwise harmful to the Services. PIBOOGO reserves the right to cooperate fully with law enforcement, and to involve and share information with law enforcement, governmental agencies, or other oversight bodies if PIBOOGO suspects illegal activity may be taking place.

18. Termination
If you breach any of these Brand Terms, PIBOOGO will have the right to temporarily suspend or permanently terminate your Brand Account, your eligibility to participate in any program (including PIBOOGO Direct) or promotions offered by PIBOOGO, and/or terminate these Brand Terms and/or the General Terms, in its sole discretion and without prior notice to you. PIBOOGO reserves the right to revoke your access to and use of the Services at any time, with or without cause.
In the event PIBOOGO terminates these Brand Terms or your Brand Account for your breach, you will remain liable for all amounts due hereunder. You may terminate your relationship with PIBOOGO at any time by contacting us or as otherwise indicated in your Brand Account portal. PIBOOGO will take down your Shop Page as soon as practicable and will close your Brand Account once there has been an accounting of all monies due and owing. In the event of any termination of your Brand Account, all program benefits or other promotional incentives accrued or earned by you or related to your Brand Account will cease or otherwise be canceled.
